# XARRAY + DASK: OUT-OF-CORE, LABELED ARRAYS IN PYTHON

## Overview

This repository contains python scripts, Jupyter notebooks produced while exploring the realm of Distributed Atmospheric and Oceanic Data Analysis using Xarray and Dask.

**Xarray** provides labeled, multi-dimensional arrays. **Dask** provides a system for parallel computing. Together, they allow for easy analysis of scientific datasets that donâ€™t fit into memory.
